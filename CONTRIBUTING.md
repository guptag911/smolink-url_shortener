* Friendly tutorial: http://makeapullrequest.com/

### Submitting a pull request
* The smaller the proposed change, the better. If youâ€™d like to propose two unrelated changes, submit two pull requests.

* The more information, the better. Make judicious use of the pull request body. Describe what changes were made, why you made them, and what impact they will have for users.

* If this is your first pull request, it may help to understand [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

* Including screenshots/video of final interface/changes in your pull request is a must.
